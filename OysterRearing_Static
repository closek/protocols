Protocol: C. gigas Larval Rearing - Tank Cleaning & Feeding

Created by: Collin J. Closek, 2015-4-11

Purpose: Early larval rearing guide for C. gigas static tank set-up (25gal tanks)

- Prepare Tanks -
1.	Ensure that the current tank thermometers read 25°C (+/-1°C)
2.	Drain FSW source pipe for about 20s, to flush out standing water in pipe
3.	Begin to fill new (cleaned) tanks with FSW (@19°C), fill each to 22.5gal line
4.	Turn off one set of current tank heaters, they require a few minutes to cool down
5.	Grab 4 cleaned tri-pours from Dry Lab
6.	Prepare 3gal of source Vortexx – add 3 squirts to 3 gal of tap water in 5gal “Dirty” Bucket
7.	Pour 1gal into other “Dirty” Bucket to be used as cleaning bucket
8.	Pour a bit of 1gal Vortexx off onto bench top and wipe down with sponge
9.	Fill FSW bucket with 2gal FSW (19°C) to be used as source for clean FSW and add one clean tri-pour to serve as a scoop 
10.	Take out heaters that were turned off and place into Vortexx bucket
11.	Scrub heater and sensor with gloved hand 
12.	Rinse cleaned heating element and sensor with FSW, by pouring over element
13.	Place on bench top to transfer sockit box to other side of bench
14.	Check volume of FSW in tank
15.	Move over sockit box and place heating element into corresponding tanks
16.	Ensure heating sensor is adhered to the side of the tank at 20gal mark or lower
17.	Add bubblers – blue tubing and bubbler stones should be drying from last use in Dry Lab
18.	Check temperatures in current tanks and then transfer the thermometers to new tanks with heaters now in them
19.	Repeat steps 4 and 10-17 for second set of tanks

- Transfer Larvae -
20.	Collect needed screen sizes, see Appendix for screen size needs & arrangement
21.	Collect siphon and plunger (typically hanging on wall in greenhouse)
22.	All screening item tools need to be flushed with Vortexx & then fresh water hose before and after use
23.	Fill FSW bucket with (>22°C) FSW from tanks using FSW tri-pour scoop
24.	Fill squirt bottle with FSW as well
25.	WAIT until temperature in new tanks has reached above 22°C BEFORE beginning larval screening
26.	Stack screen sieve on top of base and smaller tank lid, place below tank
27.	Pre-wet screen with FSW
28.	Put siphon into interior tank first, ensure sieve is below siphon and use plunger to begin draining tank
29.	Place siphon hose in the center of the sieve to reduce potential splashing
30.	As tank gets low, have siphon stand against inside wall to enable the siphon to drain as much as possible from tank, reducing the weight of the tank
31.	Carefully pour the remaining water into the sieve (make sure both bulkhead spout & top of tank are over sieve)
32.	Use tri-pour scoop to pour FSW onto inside walls and pour wash into sieve
33.	Continue to keep tank and bulkhead over sieve while squirting inside walls and corners to wash remaining larvae from tank – paying special attention to the concentration of larvae pooling and make sure they get pour into sieve, as well as at the lip of the tank
34.	Once all larvae has been reasonably washed from the tank, rinse the larvae in the sieve
35.	Tilt the sieve while pouring water over sieve to try to concentrate larvae to one end
36.	Use the squirt bottle to rinse any stragglers from the screen in a sweeping motion to spread the water evenly and help pool the larvae
37.	If screening larval size or concentration, in a new (clean) tri-pour, pour ~200ml FSW and rinse concentrated larvae from screen into tri-pour
38.	If not screening, you can rinse larvae directly into the new corresponding tank, which should now be close to 25°C (careful not to rinse larvae close to bulkhead, otherwise they may spill out of the tank)
39.	Repeat these screening steps for all tanks.

- Screen Larvae - **every 4-6 days**
40.	Take tri-pour with desired size fraction of larvae fill to 800ml FSW
41.	Bring tri-pour to Dry Lab
42.	Obtain 24-well plate, tri-pour plunger, 1000ul pipette, and filtered tips
43.	Plunge plunger up and down carefully in tri-pour to evenly stratify larvae, as you pull the plunger up take-up 200ul of larvae in FSW, add to first well of plate
44.	Take two more samples for replication, pipetting 200ul into new wells 
45.	Place plate under dissecting scope, Press M twice so that the light under turns on
46.	Count the number of larvae in each well, and record the counts (difficult since they are swimming, you can add a drop of Ethanol if needed, but not that they are swimming & dark – important indicator of health)
47.	Average your larval counts
48.	To calculate the total concentration of larvae at that size fraction:
average value x 5 x 800 = total number of larvae in that size fraction
49.	Pipet a drop of larvae onto clean slide to view and measure larvae w/ micrometer in compound scope
50.	Repeat steps 40-49 for each tank

51.	Collect a new tri-pour and 250ml cup, then head to green house
52.	Determine which cultures are best for the current larval size
53.	Identify algal cultures that are ready to use (indicated by green tape), ask if not sure
54.	Algal concentrations should be between 40,000-100,000 cells/ml for swimming larvae
55.	Use concentration wand to get rough concentration estimates
56.	Calculate algal concentration by hemocytometer under the compound scope
57.	Add 40,000 cells/ml of algae to the tanks and add volume needed by pouring into 250ml dosing cup **Repeat this again before leaving**

- Clean Materials -
58.	Pour 1L of source Vortexx into Vortexx aliquot cleaning bucket 
59.	Bring tanks onto floor 
60.	Wipe down lower table top with sponge and Vortexx
61.	Remove lids and stack ontop of each other onto one tank
62.	Clean tanks using clean sponge (rinsed out with fresh water hose) and new Vortexx
63.	Using sponge transfer liberal amount of Vortexx to tank and thoroughly scrub inside walls, especially in the corners/edges, lip, and bottom
64.	Repeat above step for each tank, then continue to lids 
65.	After scrubbing each lid (inside and out) rinse with fresh water hose
66.	Tilt lids against table (inside of lid should be facing table to allow water to drain)
67.	After rinsing lids, clean outside of tank
68.	Tilting tank onto it’s side wipe outside walls with Vortexx, twirling tank to wipe whole tank
69.	While tank is on it’s side wipe bottom to remove any mildew
70.	Spray out inside, outside, and bottom of tank with fresh water hose
71.	Rest bottom of tank on the bottom of table to allow fresh water to drain off and collect to eventually pour out.
72.	Repeat for all tanks
73.	Put tanks back onto tabletop and put on lid
74.	Collect bubbler stones and blue tubing, put into tri-pour with new Vortexx
75.	Collect all used tri-pours, fill one with Vortexx, set aside one for remaining algal feeding
76.	Bring tri-pours to Dry Lab sink
77.	Collect slides, hemocytometer, Pastuer Pipettes and place into tri-pour with Vortexx
78.	After feeding again, wash/rinse all plastic and glassware with Vortexx and finally rinse with tap water
79.	Allow to dry in drying rack and on paper towel for the next time
